🎯 PortSwigger Academy Breakdown
📚 "Getting Started with Burp Suite" Modules
Burp Interface Navigation: Dashboard, project setup, tool configurations

Proxy Fundamentals: Interception rules, request/response modification

Target Scope: Site map development, scope management

Repeater Usage: Manual request manipulation and testing

Intruder Basics: Payload positioning and attack configurations

🛠️ Burp Suite Module Mastery
🔄 Proxy Module - Traffic Interception
bash
# Browser Proxy Configuration
Proxy Settings: 127.0.0.1:8080
Intercept: ON for both requests and responses
Key Skills Acquired:

✅ Real-time HTTP/S traffic interception

✅ Request modification (parameters, headers, methods)

✅ Response manipulation and analysis

✅ Interception filters and rules configuration

Practical Exercise:

http
# Intercepted GET Request
GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: test.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Cookie: session=abc123

# Modified Request
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: test.com
User-Agent: Burp-Tester/1.0
Cookie: session=admin_token
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
🎯 Repeater Module - Manual Testing
Workflow Mastered:

Capture request in Proxy

Send to Repeater for manual manipulation

Modify parameters, headers, and body content

Replay requests and analyze differences

Testing Scenarios:

Parameter tampering (IDOR testing)

HTTP method changing (GET → POST)

Header injection attempts

Authentication bypass testing

🎯 Target Module - Site Mapping
Scope Management:

bash
# Target Scope Configuration
Included Hosts: *.target.com
Excluded URLs: logout, delete-account
Site Map Features Utilized:

✅ Automatic discovery of endpoints and parameters

✅ Visual representation of application structure

✅ Filtering by file type, extension, and status

✅ Annotations and comments for collaboration

⚡ Intruder Module - Basic Fuzzing
Attack Types Explored:

Sniper: Single parameter fuzzing

Battering Ram: Multiple parameters with same payloads

Pitchfork: Multiple parameters with different payload lists

Cluster Bomb: Comprehensive parameter combinations

Simple Fuzzing Example:

http
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=§admin§&password=§test§
🔧 Configuration Guide Created
🌐 Browser Proxy Setup
Firefox Configuration:

text
Manual proxy configuration: 127.0.0.1
Port: 8080
No proxy for: localhost, 127.0.0.1
Chrome Configuration:

bash
# Launch command with proxy
google-chrome --proxy-server=127.0.0.1:8080
🔐 SSL Certificate Installation
Process Documented:

Browse to http://burp from configured browser

Download cacert.der certificate

Convert to .pem format if needed

Import into browser certificate store

Enable trust for SSL identification

Verification Command:

bash
curl --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 https://example.com
⚙️ Burp Project Configuration
Recommended Settings:

Project: Temporary project in memory

Configuration: Burp Default (fine-tuned)

Proxy Listeners: Running on all interfaces

Intercept: Client requests only (initial setup)

📸 Evidence Collection
✅ Successful Interception Proof
Screenshot 1: Browser traffic captured in Proxy tab

Screenshot 2: Modified request with custom headers

Screenshot 3: Repeater module with manipulated parameters

Screenshot 4: Site map showing discovered endpoints

Screenshot 5: Intruder attack with payload positions

🔍 Real-World Testing Scenarios
Parameter Manipulation: Changed user_id=1 to user_id=0

HTTP Method Testing: Converted GET to POST requests

Header Injection: Added X-Forwarded-For and X-Original-URL

Cookie Tampering: Modified session values and privileges

🎯 Checkpoint Challenge
The Critical Question: "How do you configure Burp to intercept HTTPS traffic?"

ANSWER: Install Burp's CA Certificate 🎉
Step-by-Step Process:

Configure Browser Proxy:

text
HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1:8080
SSL Proxy: 127.0.0.1:8080
Install Burp CA Certificate:

Navigate to http://burp in your browser

Click "CA Certificate" to download

Import into browser's certificate store

Enable trust for SSL interception

Browser-Specific Instructions:
Firefox: Settings → Privacy & Security → Certificates → View Certificates → Import
Chrome: Settings → Security → Manage Certificates → Trusted Root Certification Authorities → Import

Verification:

bash
# Test HTTPS interception
curl --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 https://google.com
Why This Works:

Burp acts as a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) proxy

Generates dynamic certificates for HTTPS sites

Browser trusts Burp's CA, allowing decryption

Enables inspection of encrypted traffic
