📚 Wordlist Effectiveness Comparison
🧪 Tested Wordlists:
Wordlist	Size	Best For	Findings
common.txt	4,614 entries	Quick scans	Basic directories, fast results
big.txt	20,478 entries	Comprehensive	Hidden admin panels, backup files
directory-list-2.3-medium.txt	220,560 entries	Deep scans	Obscure endpoints, development files
raft-small-words.txt	37,028 entries	Balanced approach	Good coverage with reasonable speed
📊 Performance Analysis:
bash
# Common.txt results (fastest)
gobuster dir -u http://target -w common.txt -t 50
→ Completed in 45 seconds, found 8 directories

# Big.txt results (balanced)
gobuster dir -u http://target -w big.txt -t 50  
→ Completed in 3 minutes, found 14 directories

# Directory-list-2.3-medium (thorough)

→ Completed in 25 minutes, found 22 directories
🎯 TryHackMe "OhSINT" Room Application
🕵️ OSINT Meets Directory Enumeration
Techniques Applied:

✅ Image metadata analysis for hidden information

✅ Social media reconnaissance

✅ Directory busting on discovered domains

✅ Integration of multiple intelligence sources

Key Learning: Directory enumeration is most effective when combined with OSINT for target intelligence.

📋 Directory Enumeration Methodology
🔍 Phase 1: Initial Reconnaissance
bash
# Quick scan with common wordlist
gobuster dir -u http://target.com -w common.txt -x php,html -t 50 -o quick_scan.txt

# Focus on common backup extensions
ffuf -u http://target.com/FUZZ -w common.txt -e .bak,.old,.txt,.zip
🎯 Phase 2: Targeted Enumeration
bash
# Based on initial findings, probe deeper
gobuster dir -u http://target.com/admin -w common.txt -x php,html

# Check for common admin panels
ffuf -u http://target.com/FUZZ -w admin_wordlists.txt
📡 Phase 3: Comprehensive Scan
bash
# Full scan with large wordlist
gobuster dir -u http://target.com -w big.txt -x php,html,txt,json,bak -t 100

# Recursive scanning on discovered paths
ffuf -u http://target.com/FUZZ -w common.txt -recursion -recursion-depth 2
📊 Phase 4: Analysis & Reporting
Categorize discovered endpoints

Identify sensitive files (config, backups, logs)

Document accessible administrative interfaces

Note potential vulnerability indicators

🎯 Checkpoint Challenge
The Critical Question: "What's the advantage of using different wordlists?"

ANSWER: Comprehensive Coverage & Efficiency 🎉
Strategic Advantages:

Progressive Discovery:

bash
# Start small for quick wins
gobuster dir -u http://target -w common.txt

# Expand for deeper discovery  
gobuster dir -u http://target -w big.txt
Target-Specific Effectiveness:

Common.txt: Fast results for standard web structures

Technology-specific lists: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal tailored wordlists

Custom wordlists: Generated from target content and technologies

Resource Optimization:

Small lists: Quick initial reconnaissance

Medium lists: Balanced depth vs time

Large lists: Comprehensive when time permits

Avoiding Detection:

Rotating wordlists reduces pattern recognition

Smaller lists generate less noise

Targeted lists appear more like legitimate traffic

Real-World Example:

bash
# Quick admin panel discovery
ffuf -u http://target.com/FUZZ -w admin_paths.txt
→ Found: /admin, /administrator, /wp-admin

# Then comprehensive content discovery
ffuf -u http://target.com/FUZZ -w directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
→ Found: /backup, /config, /logs, /api/v1/users
